# Release Note for 10321

## Notable new features
* Completely disable caching for any resource in `web\SphApp` when HttpDebugging is enabled
* All the RX creates new item will be done via dialog, thus avoiding mistakes where name is not properly set
* Shared system settings is move from `*.config` file to environment variable


## Configuration with **Environment Variable**
Rx Developer configuration has always been using `*.config` file and some `*.json` files, there are times when these are just not enough or in some cases making it very hard to do anything useful.

Environment Variable allows you to be more flexible about how do you want your application to be deployed and run. All the setting name used by RX Developer will starts with `RX_<YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME>_<SETTING>`.

For now your `*.config` file only need to specify the `Application name `
```xml
    <add key="sph:ApplicationName" value="YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME"/>
```
this should be in every config file in your solution
* web\web.config
* tools\*.exe.config
* subscribers.host\*.exe.congig
* etc..



## Caching is disabled when in debugging mode
On a developer workstation where you would normally have single instance of RX running, and there would be a lot of changes to your files, and these changes cannot be seen unless you have *Dev Tool* open and do **HARD RELOAD** and some extreme cases, a restart to IIS is required.

You can now easily avoid all that pains with just a simple configuration setting in your `web\web.config` file

```xml
<system.web>
   .. other stuff here
  <compilation debug="true" targetFramework="4.6"/>
```


## Creates new item dialog
From *dev.home* when you add new item, a pop up dialog will be shown that requires you to fill the important information for creating new item

You can also use the *Solution Explorer* ![Soltution Explorer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NNJu0mi32GM/Vnd2v6Us_oI/AAAAAAAAKi0/WH2l5IMy8jw/s2048-Ic42/%25255BUNSET%25255D.png) to create new item
