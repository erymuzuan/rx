# Release Note

## 10335
* restapi.adapter.dll
* core.sph.dll
* domain.sph.dll
* web.api.common
* sql.cmd.dll


## Minor updates
* WIP WEB API Permission for custom controllers


### Changed assemblies
* restapi.adapter.dll
* core.sph.dll
* domain.sph.dll
* sph.builder.exe
* web.api.common
* sql.cmd.dll

### Bugs fixes
* sph.builder error reporting, only errors will be in red, but this is not guaranteed since the build are running concurrently, so cross threading might happened and the console color might not be reset in time.
* designers for restapi ReceiveLocation is in `core.sph`
* Anynomous claims
* When start web server from command line, use `Get-ProcessVariable` in sql.cmd module to get the `LoggerPort`


## 10334

### Changed assemblies
* restapi.adapter.dll (nothing changed , but the file in 10333 should be copied to tools directory)
* domain.sph.dll
* sph.builder.exe

### Bugs fixes
* `ScriptFunctoid` arg name, is now verified against reserved C# keywors
* `EntityForm` diagnostics no longer requires you to specify a `OperationEndpoint` for your form, so we could use `ButtonElement` to invoke anything, rather than relying on toolbar, or we could make the form readonly
* Use Polly retry when doing data migration from SQL to elasticsearch, to avoid choking elasticsearch
* Compiling `Trigger` action with source will now look for the `Action` in trigger.json source file with `WebId` instead of `Title`, since `Title` do changes.
* Compiling `Trigger` with sph.builder will update the _generated_ source , so you will have a compatible binary for debugging

## 10333

### Changed assemblies
* restapi.adapter.dll
* domain.sph.dll
* sph.builder.exe


### Enhancements

### TransformDefinition

`ScriptFunctoid` supports for users args, to enable , add `ScriptFunctoid` to your mapping designer , right click to edit property

![https://i.imgur.com/SugFqpV.png](https://i.imgur.com/SugFqpV.png)

1. The argument name must be a valid C# identifier, so it cannot contains " ", . etc
2. Select the argument type
3. Click trash to remove
4. Now it's possible to use the arg within your script

** QUIRKS **
The mapping designer, still doesn't support this features to the full extend, you cannot just simply drag the source into your `ScriptFunctoid` arguments. Once you have added args, click `OK` on the dialog, then `Save`.. make sure your workers is running. The reload the designer, now you should be able to drag a source to your script arg

#### WebApiReceiveLocation

1. Support the ability to process the request as a batch, all or nothing option, if 1 or more row fail to be parsed correctly, then the whole batch is rejected with 422 error code
2. supports the ability to buffer request stream before processing, use it with caution, you will be bypassing Streaming so generally it's bad idea for very large file.


### Bugs fixes
* sph.builder.exe verify that certain folders might not necessarily exists in sources e.g. `ReceiveLocation`, `ReceivePort`, `OperationEndpoint` and `QueryEndpoint`


## 10332

### Bugs fixes
* More bugs fixes in TransformDefinition `Functoid` sorting, hopefully we got this one right this time around
* sph.bulder tool no longer try to deploy the compiled assembly, do this manually, since some of the dll are locked by the sph.builder it self

### Minor enhancements
* sph.builder use `Colorful.Console` to show the compilation errors


## 10331

### Bugs fixes
* Functoid sorting - not entirely resolved , The upper most functoid is moved to the top in the `FunctoidCollection` manually, in this example the `ConfigurationSettingFunctoid` is the upper most functoid

```json
{  
  "FunctoidCollection": {
    "$type": "Bespoke.Sph.Domain.ObjectCollection`1[[Bespoke.Sph.Domain.Functoid, domain.sph]], domain.sph",
    "$values": [

      {
        "$type": "Bespoke.Sph.Domain.ConfigurationSettingFunctoid, database.lookup",
        "Section": "AppSetting",
        "Key": "oal",
        "WebId": "94103be0-1796-485c-cc6c-5b9d591d569c"
      },
      {
        "$type": "Bespoke.Sph.Domain.ConstantFunctoid, domain.sph",
        "TypeName": "System.Int32, mscorlib",
        "Value": "0",
        "WebId": "f4032e61-f666-4dc9-b865-d0e8cc2973f3"
      }
    ]
  }


}

```


## 10330

### Notable improvements

* LookupFormElement - looking up an Entity with `Name` property instead of the `Id`
* `money` ko binding handlers didn't update the text when the value is updated

## 10329

### Bugs fixes
* custom-form route url, when editiong the form route
* queryPaging search
* Endpoint permissions for RxSystem, List and Aggregate (not in designer yet), but use the default permissions setting

    ```
    e.g.
    /api/resources/?q=MemberName=what ever
    or

    /api/resources/?q=this AND that -those
    ```


## 10328

Bugs fixes to WebApi permissions

## 10327

### Notable improvements
* Sql Server Adapter support for CLR naming strategy for tables and columns, rather than producing `PascalCase` strategy, developer can choose `Auto`, that will try to follow the original name as close as possible.
* With `Auto` strategy, the table name in Messaging action will closely follow the original name too
* Sql Server Adapter connection string can be configured at runtime using config or Environment variable


```xml
<!-- in web.config and workers.runner.windows.service.exe.config -->
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="{Adapter Name}" value="" provider=""/>
</connectionStrings>
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("RX_{APPLICATION_NAME}_{AdapterName}ConnectionString", "{The connection string}", "Machine|Process")
```
