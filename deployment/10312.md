#Release Note for 10312

## Notable new features
* Enable custom Entity with TreatDataAsSource, this will allow all the data be saved as json in `sources\<entity name>` thus allowing to be managed by version control. So if you have lookup data that you want to share with your team members, just check TreatDataAsSource in `"General Properties"` tab.
* sph.builder in tools has also been upgraded to reflect the changes happened in TreatDataAsSource, so running it with
```batch
.\tools\sph.builder.exe .\sources\EntityDefinition\<your entity>.json
```
will compile to output folder and restore all the `.\sources\<your entity>\*.json` data in SQL server and Elasticsearch

There are situations where your `sph.builder.config` is not properly set, in that case open your `.\tools\sph.builder.config` using any text editor, and there a few lines that you need to change, the best place to look for the correct value is your `.\web\web.config`

* sph.builder will also build your `Designation` objects, allowing you to restore all the new roles that has been created by your team mates without using the `mru` again, this build also include the new `mru` that enable you to add roles to existing user.
* Ability to create run more console.workers with different instant name, and ability to set PrefetchCount on each subsriber, using config you can set the PrefetchCount
```xml
<add key="sph:PrefetchCount:{Queue name}" value="{new value}"/>
```
the example below will change `persistence` subscriber default PrefetchCount from 1 to 5
```xml
<add key="sph:PrefetchCount:persistence" value="5"/>
```
