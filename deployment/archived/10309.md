#Release Note for 10309

## New notable features
Enhanced diagnostics for most of the compilation units, you now can write your own diagnostics and export it as  `[Export(typeof(IBuildDiagnostics))]`

sample code to create a simple route validation for EntityForm

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Bespoke.Sph.Domain.diagnostics
{
    [Export(typeof(IBuildDiagnostics))]
    public class RouteDiagnostics : BuilDiagnostic
    {
        private string RoutePattern = @"^[a-z0-9-._]*$";
        private string NamePattern = @"^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9 -]*$";


        public override async Task<BuildError[]> ValidateErrorsAsync(EntityForm form, EntityDefinition entity)
        {
            var errors = new List<BuildError>();

            var validRoute = new Regex(RoutePattern);
            if (!validRoute.Match(form.Route).Success)
                errors.Add(new BuildError(form.WebId) { Message = "Route must be lower case.You cannot use symbol or number as first character, or other chars except _ - ." });

            return errors.ToArray();

        }
    }
}
```

It's now easier to ship a new diagnostics, without recompiling the core dll, all we have to do is implement `IBuildDiagnostics` interface direclty or in this example, just inherit `BuildDiagnostic` class and override any implementations as you wish.
