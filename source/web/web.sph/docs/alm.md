2. Design
3. Development/Coding
4. Testing 
5. Deployment

###Development and coding 
Development and coding is normally a major drag and the most time consuming in the development process. It also requires people who are highly skilled and enthusiatic about the programming language of choice. `Rx Developer` helps to eliminates or greatly reduced the need for coding. This will help you to develop faster and with less defects too, since less coding mean less defects.

###Testing
You can't test if you have yet to finish development, with `Rx Developer` once you have done your design, you can publish your work to your testing environment in minutes and let your business users test them immediately

###Deployment
All it takes is just one click, no headache about configuration and evironment settings anymore

### Changes
Enterprise application development is all about how well you deal with changes, as we all heard, the only constant in enterprise application development is the `change` it self. `Rx Developer` helps you carry out your changes easier and lot faster. This will enable your enterprise to evolve and respond to change with ease.
