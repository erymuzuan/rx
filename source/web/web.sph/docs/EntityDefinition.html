<h1>EntityDefinition</h1>

<p>The first core concept of SPH is the <code>Entity</code>. This plays a very vital role in the whole SPH programming concept. <code>Entity</code> is not a <code>table</code> translated from relational world. Thus it is hugely different than <code>table</code> and <code>tuples</code> from relational world.</p>

<p>To really understand the power of <code>Entity</code> is to forget everthing you know about relational database and it's related technologies such as <code>object relational mapper(ORM)</code>.The concepts of foreign key, parent child, and normal forms just simply didn't exist in the first place.</p>

<p>An <code>Entity</code> is an object that you are interested in to track their life in your problem domains. This could be <code>Customer</code> if you are developing a Customer relationship management or <code>Patient</code> in case clinical information system. It's also know as <code>Root</code> object. Then there are <code>Value</code> objects, these are objects that attached to an entity, and would not exist without the <code>Entity</code> for example <code>Address</code> for your <code>Customer</code>, the <code>Address</code> alone is not an <code>Entity</code> as it is quite useless without the <code>Customer</code>. But if you are developing a Geographic information System for postal service than an <code>Address</code> could be your <code>Entity</code>.</p>

<p>As such, think an <code>Entity</code> as the a traditional paper folder where it holds many paper records inside. Take a folder for a <code>Patient</code> in a hospital environment. It might have these fields writen on it.<br />
* The name of the patient<br />
* The registration number(MRN)<br />
* Date of birth<br />
* Address<br />
    * Street<br />
    * State<br />
    * Postal code<br />
* etc</p>

<p>and there could be a number of documents inside it, such as visit records, medical history, referals etc.</p>

<p>So your <code>Entity</code> will be called <code>Patient</code>, and <code>Visit</code> will be your value object, well in this case there will be many <code>Visit</code>s</p>

<p>In SPH, this could easily be modelled as follows</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>Entity:Patient
    Value:FullName
    Value:Mrn
    Value:Address
        Value:Street
        Value:Postalcode
        Value:State
    Value:Visit list**
        Value:DateTime
        Value:Title
        Value:Doctor     
    Value:Medical History list
        Value:DateTime
        Value:ClinicalNote
      ...
       ... 
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is very natural way storing your data, in a way that we all understand, there's no need to artificially model after tables and relatioships. The way SPH take care of your data is known as <code>Document</code> store database. You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">Document database</a> in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Notice that <code>Address</code> is just another object that belongs to the <code>Patient</code>, what makes the <code>Patient</code> and <code>Address</code> diferrent is very minimal<br />
*<code>Patient</code> is an object that you interested to track it's life time<br />
* <code>Address</code> is just an object that belong to another <code>Value</code> object or an <code>Entity</code><br />
*<code>Patient</code> has an identitfier field or what we call RecordName<br />
*<code>Address</code> doesn't have any identifier field, as such with it's parent, it's imposible to tell if an <code>Address</code> belong to patient A or patient B. <code>Value</code> object does not live in isolation.</p>
