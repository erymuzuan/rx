#How to Scheduling a Workflow

Workflow processes can be scheduled to trigger on a particular time, similar to a scheduled job. You could for example schedule it to run on daily basis, weekly basis or even on monthly basis. In your workflow, just drag the [`Scheduled Trigger Activity `](ScheduledTriggerActivity.html) and set your preference time for the scheduled job to run.

In this example our schedule is set to be running on the last day of the month. 

Add action and select for Monthly.

Here, you can set the datetime for when your schedule to start running. Next, you just have to select on which month you would like the schedule to run and select `Last Day`. You can also set the date for when the schedule to expired if require.
