#How to make a field more prominent in Search

`Boost` is a helpful properties in your [`Entity Definition`](EntityDefiniton.html). It allows you to scale one query than another to the search engine. You can choose to place your result field on top and you can also give negative boost value so your result field would come last in the result set.

In `EntityDefinition`, after you add your element or attributes in your schema designer, you may then set the value for the `Boost` for the respective field under your field's Member Properties.
