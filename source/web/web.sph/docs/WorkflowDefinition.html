<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><code>WorklfowDefinition</code> represent the core work that your app needs to do, while <code>EntityDefinition</code> represents set of data definition for you app.<code>WorklfowDefinition</code> is much richer in terms of capabilities and complexities. It used primaryly to buil a <code>state-machine</code> for your application, which could represent a long running process with the abilit to be presisted and de-hydrated when the moment comes.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p><code>WorkflowDefinition</code> is just a simple object with attributes, or fields, but we call them <code>Variable</code>. The <code>Variables</code> holds the user state of an <code>instance</code>.These are normally things that goes into your <code>ScreenActivity</code> forms, as well as other states variables such loop counter etc.</p>
<p><code>Variables</code> are the things that your workflow interact with. Lets walkthrough an example for a workflow to process a referal request for specialist, in a traditional code development, we might write something like</p>
<pre>public class ProcessReferal : Workflow
{
    // a member to hold the patient object
    public Patient Patient{set;get;}

    // a member for the requested specialist
    public string Specialist{set;get;}

    //.. other members and methods


}</pre>

<p>So all your variables will be written as public field in your <code>Workflow</code> class, in which you will manipulate these <code>Variables</code> as <code>Activities</code> are executed.</p>
<p><a href="Variable.html">See more about variables here</a></p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p><code>Variables</code> to lets you define states for your <code>Workflow</code>, and <code>Activity</code> is the way you define <code>Operation</code> for your <code>Workflow</code>. If we were to illustrate a <code>Workflow</code> with traditional code approach. This is what we have</p>
<p><pre><br>public class ProcessReferal : Workflow<br>{<br>    // a member to hold the patient object<br>    public Patient Patient{set;get;}</p>
<pre><code>// a member for the requested specialist
public string Specialist{set;get;}

// a member for the specialist
public string Specialist{set;get;}

// a member for the specialist response
public string Response{set;get;}

// The actual workflow
public void Start()
{
    this.SendEmailToSpecialist();               // 1
    await this.InitSpecialistConfirmation();    // 2
    if(this.Response == &quot;Yes&quot;)                  //
        this.CreateAppointmentActivity();       // 3
    else
        this.EmailPatientDeclined();            // 3
}

// send email activity
public void SendEmailToSpecialist()
{
    var smtp = new SmtpClient();
    smtp.Send(to:this.Specialist,subject: &quot; Referal request for &quot; + this.Patient.FullName, body:&quot;...&quot;); 
}


//.. other members and methods
</code></pre><p>}<br></pre><br>As you can see, <code>Activities</code> is nothing more than a function to perform an <code>Operation</code>, what it differs between the normal class is, it&#39;s ability to be persisted between activities.</p>
<p><code>Rx Developer</code> <code>WorkflowDesigner</code> on the hand lets you forget about writing the code altogether, instead it will help generate the codes for you. The benefits of using <code>WorkflowDesigner</code> are tremendous, the code are tested to be robust, less chances for bugs, it also encapsulate the developers from the inner working of a state machince and let you focus on your actual business needs.</p>
<p>Core concepts of <code>Worklfow</code> is a series of <code>Activities</code> it contains, these activities are generally can be divided into 2 categories</p>
<ul>
<li>System Activity</li>
<li>Human Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>An <code>Activity</code> is a unit of work performed by the Workflow engine, it&#39;s like a method in your <code>EntityDefinition</code>, except that it could be persisted when it&#39;s done,befor continuing for the <code>NextActivity</code></p>
<h3 id="system-activity">System Activity</h3>
<p>Represent set of <code>Activities</code> executed by the workflow engine</p>
<h3 id="human-activity">Human Activity</h3>
<p>Represent set of <code>Activities</code> performed by human or external system. <code>ScreenActivity</code> and <code>ReceiveActivity</code> are the most common one.</p>
<h3 id="asynchoronous-activity">Asynchoronous Activity</h3>
<p>There are other aspects in <code>Activity</code> execution, what we call it&#39;s <code>Asynchoronosity</code>. This is a behaviour that some activities have which allow them to be initiated and at some point of time in the future, be executed. Most of human <code>Activity</code> are at the same time <code>Asynchronouse</code>, i.e. they get initiated before it could be executed. Take <code>ScreenActivity</code> for example, it will not be executed directly, but initiated when it turns to execute. What happen is, in the initializing process, emails and notification will be sent to the <code>performers</code> for the task. Once the email sent, the <code>performer</code> will have a link point for the execution, the moment he clicks the submit button, the <code>Activity</code> is executed.</p>
