#FunctionField
## Overview
`FunctionField` is a primary and the easiest way to generate a dynamic values at runtime, this value be not be know at design time, as such using [ConstantField](ConstantField.htm) is imposible.


##Properties
<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered">
    <thead>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>ScriptEngine</td><td> - The script engine use to evaluate your script. The current implementation use Microsoft Roslyn services, thus only a valid C# code could be evaluated</td></tr>
<tr><td>Script</td><td> - The piece of code that you'll need to evaluate</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


## C# Script
Microsoft Roslyn Service script engine allows you to run any arbitary C# code within a host object. `Rx Developer` will create a host object for your script which allow you to access few this such as 

* The current record as `item`
* All the types within your Entity or Workflow assembly
* All the types within domain.sph
* All the system types, so you can use basic .Net framework

You should only write your script in 2 ways

Short expression
```
DateTime.Now
```
The example give you the simplest form of expression that will return the current date time.

Multile line script with complex script 
<pre>
var second = DateTime.Now.Seconds;
return string.Format("ITEM_{0}",second);
</pre>


##Things to aware
Script will not be compiled and validated at design time, if there's error in your script it might be hard to find, see the event log to see the actual code generated by your script. This may help you troubleshoot the problem
