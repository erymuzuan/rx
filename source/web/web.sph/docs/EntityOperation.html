<ol>
<li>The name of the <code>EntityOperation</code> , it must be a valid identifier for method name, as such cannot contain spaces, or special chars except <code>_</code>, and must start with a letter. For consistency we recommend using <code>PascalCase</code> e.g. '<code>Demote</code></li>
<li>The <code>EntityDefinition</code> that you are working on</li>
<li>The name of the <code>EntityOperation</code>, refer #1</li>
<li>A set of <code>BusinessRule</code> you want to validate with, prior to executing your operation. If any of the rules failed to operation will not proceed and error messages will be show to the user.<br />
Please refer to the <a href="businessrule.htm">BusinessRule</a> for more details about <code>BusinessRule</code></li>
<li>Set of roles/authorization required to execute the operation. The use must be in one of these roles in other for the execution to succeed, else status code <a href="http.403.htm">Status 403</a> will be returned.</li>
<li>You can specify <a href="childsetteraction.htm">setter actions</a> to set the values of your entity fields/attributes. For example setting the <code>Rating</code> field for <code>Customer</code> entity to be 1 less than the previous value using a <a href="functionfield.htm">FuctionField</a> <code>item.Rating -1</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>EntityOperation</code> designer will not compile your code, clicking save will only save it to your <code>EntityDefinition</code> in which you will have to <code>Publish</code> it from the <code>EntityDefinition</code> designer.</p>

<p>Once compiled, a new Asp.Net MVC <code>Action</code> will be created with the name of the operation. Where it would take an instance of the <code>EntityDefinition</code> from the input stream, and run the specified business rules and if all passed the setter action will be called before submitting it to the persistence layer.<br />
If you need to modify or do other works from this <code>EntityOperation</code> apart from simple field settings, you can use <a href="Trigger.html"><code>Trigger</code></a> where you<br />
can call additional <a href="SetterAction.html"><code>SetterAction</code></a>, or <a href="EmailAction.html"><code>EmailAction</code></a> or <a href="StartWorkflowAction.html"><code>StartWorkflowAction</code></a>.</p>

<p>Operation can be decorated with permissions attribute, this consist set of <code>role</code> they user must have to perform the operation.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Anynomous</code> is for public unathenticated and authenticated users. Selecting this attribute will nullify the rest</li>
<li><code>Everybody</code> is only for authenticated users. Selecting this attribute will nullify the rest</li>
<li>Custom roles, you can select 1 or more of these roles but must not be together with either <code>Anynomous</code> or <code>Everybody</code></li>
</ul>
