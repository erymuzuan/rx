#Create a new column with link in your entity view

`EntityView` allows you to create a view to display your entities in a tabular manner. `EntityView` allows you to do things like filtering, sorting and specifying set of columns to be displayed. The default setting just insert a first column automatically to you table that has a link that points  to the defaul `EntityForm`.

What if you want to have another column with different text and link to another form. This could be done by just checking the `IsLinkColumn` checkbox, select your form and optionally an icon.
