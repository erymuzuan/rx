<h1>Application Development</h1>

<p>Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) is a discipline in which the process of software development take places. These might consists a set of methodolgies, best practices and design/development/project management styles of your preference.</p>

<p>SPH do not dictate the kind of SDLC or Application Lifecycle Management(ALM) of your choice, be it waterfall , RUP or one of the agile approches. What this documentation will talk about is the development processes. Normal enterprise software development processes can be broken down into these activities :</p>

<ol>
<li>User requirements/user stories</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Development/Coding</li>
<li>Testing </li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Enhacement/Changes</li>
</ol>

<h3>User requirements</h3>

<p>SPH does not eliminates the need for <code>User requirement</code>, you still have to do it or how do you figure out what the users really need. </p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>SPH make it easier for you to <code>Design</code> your app, it's built in with a lot of highly productive features to makes this process easier for your, but it doesn't necessarily remove the need to the people with good design skills and critical thinking.</p>

<h3>Development and coding</h3>

<p>Development and coding is normally a major drag and the most time consuming in the development process. It also requires people who are highly skilled and enthusiatic about the programming language of choice. SPH helps to eliminates or greatly reduced the need for coding. This will help you to develop faster, less defects code.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>You can't test if you have yet to finish development, with SPH once you have done your design, you can publish your work to your testing environment in minutes and let your business users test them immediately</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<p>All it takes is just one click, no headache about configuration and evironment settings anymore</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>Enterprise application development is all about how well you deal with changes, as we all heard, the only constant in enterprise application development is the <code>change</code> it self. SPH helps you carry out your changes easier and lot faster. This will enable your enterprise to evolve and respond to change with ease.</p>
