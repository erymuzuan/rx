                    <h4>Info</h4>
                    <p>Commercial space is a company asset that can generate income. 
                       However, if it fails to manage well the company is unable to collect the maximum profit as they
                        should. SPH provides a platform for companies to manage the system and ensure that existing commercial space 
                        can be regulated well and get rental returns  as planned.
                        With SPH, commercial space can be managed in a more orderly regulation such as
                    rental application, maintainance, complaints, rental payments and also
                    the contract management.</p>
